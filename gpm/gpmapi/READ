GPM-API v1.0 BETA
(Interpreter v1.0 Build 1)


Gpm (Git Package Manager) API can speed up downloading packages using a full
scale Package installation that is fully automated based on GPM-Api scripts.

Gpm-API can speed up large scale Package operations by feeding instructions
to the GPM Api runtime.

Please note; the GPM-API runtime is not good with spaces so it is recommended
to use _ as spaces.

Recommended usage:
[REPO_LINKS]
https://github.com/Banshee302/oSNAKE.git
[AUTOBUILD_DIR]
/usr/bin/gpm-autobuild
[OUTPUT_DIR]
/home/edin/Downloads/gpmapi/output
[LOG_FILE]
true

(end)

Please note; make sure there are no empty lines in a section, this can cause errors in parsing that are not ideal. Make sure to format your instructions properly.

Also make sure to note that you MUST format your GPM API Scripts as .gapi
file extension or else it wont be processed by the runtime.

This can help speed up Package installations on large scale operations majorly if you use it properly.

Think of this API like Compose for docker but for the GPM Package Manager.


**THIS PROGRAM EXPECTS YOU TO BE IN A UNIX/LINUX COMMAND LINE.**
